Update AI memory files. These are for YOU (AI) only - no human reads them.

Check current date/time including TimeZone using terminal

MEMORY.md (static reference):
- IPs, credential file paths, commands, architecture
- Key decisions and WHY (if you need the context)
- Update only if infrastructure/config changed

/phases/current_phase.md (session progress):
- Current phase + goal
- Done this session
- Next steps
- Blockers/issues
- Include explanations if YOU need them to understand later

Check before writing:
- /proxmox/credentials
- /www/scripts/
- /phases/

Write what YOU need to reload context cold. No more, no less.

🚨 CRITICAL: GIT COMMIT RULES 🚨

AFTER updating memory files, ALWAYS follow this workflow:

1. Run `git status` to check for changes
2. IF changes exist:
   a. STOP - Do NOT commit automatically
   b. ASK user: "Memory files updated. Ready to commit AND push changes?"
   c. WAIT for explicit approval ("yes", "commit", "push", etc.)
   d. ONLY THEN: git add, commit, push

❌ NEVER commit and/or push without asking first
❌ NEVER assume user wants to commit
❌ "action MAKE_MEMORIES" = UPDATE files only, NOT commit

✅ Exception: User explicitly says "commit everything" or "commit these changes"
