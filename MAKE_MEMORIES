Update AI memory files. These are for YOU (AI) only - no human reads them.

MEMORY.md (static reference):
- IPs, credential file paths, commands, architecture
- Key decisions and WHY (if you need the context)
- Update only if infrastructure/config changed

/phases/current_phase.md (session progress):
- Current phase + goal
- Done this session
- Next steps
- Blockers/issues
- Include explanations if YOU need them to understand later

Check before writing:
- /proxmox/credentials
- /www/scripts/
- /phases/

Write what YOU need to reload context cold. No more, no less.
