# Current Phase

**Updated:** January 11, 2026 - 1:35 PM EST

---

## ✅ COMPLETE: Phase 5 - CI/CD Pipelines (QA + GCP Both Working!)

**Infrastructure:** Production-ready with full automation (QA + GCP)
**Status:** Phases 0-5 complete, automated deployments to QA and GCP operational

---

## ✅ Completed This Session (Jan 11, 2026 - Morning Session)

**GitHub Repository Setup (9:00 AM):**
- Published home-lab-setup to GitHub
- Created comprehensive README with hardware specs
- Multiple refinements (hardware cost, Z8 G4, rpool naming)
- 8 commits total to GitHub

**Phase 5 - Test App CI/CD (10:00 AM - 11:30 AM):**
- Created test-app (nginx + animated HTML splash page)
- Built 3-stage pipeline: build → push → deploy
- Fixed Docker API version (docker:27 not docker:24.0)
- Configured CI/CD variables in GitLab
- Setup SSH keys for deployment
- **SUCCESS:** http://192.168.1.180:8080 deployed via pipeline!

**Capricorn CI/CD Integration (11:45 AM - 1:35 PM):**
- Setup dual-remote configuration (GitHub + GitLab)
- Created "production" group in GitLab
- Established branch strategy (develop → QA, production → GCP)
- **CRITICAL REFACTORING:** Renamed all "prod" → "qa" for clarity
  - run-prod.sh → run-qa.sh
  - docker-compose.prod.yml → docker-compose.qa.yml
  - Dockerfile.*.prod → Dockerfile.*.qa
  - Updated all text: "PROD Environment" → "QA Environment (192.168.1.180)"
- Fixed .gitignore blocking lib/ directories (4 missing API files!)
- Created docker-compose.qa.deploy.yml (registry-based deployment)
- Built Capricorn .gitlab-ci.yml pipeline (QA + GCP stages)
- Fixed SSH key loading in pipeline
- **SUCCESS QA:** Capricorn auto-deploys to http://192.168.1.180:5001
- **SUCCESS GCP:** Capricorn deploys to http://capricorn.gothamtechnologies.com
- Added GCP deployment stage (manual trigger on production branch)
- Installed all tools in pipeline: terraform, gcloud, kubectl, docker buildx
- Fixed service account key file creation
- Added git to prerequisites (removes buildx warning)

**Issues Resolved:**
1. Docker API version mismatch (docker:24.0 → docker:27)
2. Registry authentication (CI/CD variables)
3. SSH key deployment (runner to QA host)
4. YAML script syntax (nested strings)
5. Missing lib/api-client.ts files (.gitignore blocking lib/)
6. SSH key format in CI/CD variable
7. Naming confusion (PROD → QA refactoring)
8. Build stages not running on production branch
9. Tool installation (terraform, gcloud, kubectl in Alpine)
10. Service account key file creation from variable
11. Git missing for docker buildx metadata

## Key Achievements

**Complete CI/CD Infrastructure:**
- ✅ GitLab Server verified (git push/pull, Container Registry)
- ✅ GitLab Runner verified (Docker builds, registry push, SSH deploy)
- ✅ Test app pipeline working (validation complete)
- ✅ **Capricorn pipeline working** (production application deployed!)

**Deployment Clarity Established:**
- **DEV** = Local workstation development
- **QA** = vm-kubernetes-1 @ 192.168.1.180 (automated CI/CD)
- **GCP** = Google Cloud Platform (real production)

---

## Previous Sessions

**January 8, 2026:**
- GitHub repository setup and published
- Updated hardware specs and documentation

**December 13, 2025:**
- GitLab Runner (gitlab-runner-1) installed @ 192.168.1.182
- Docker executor configured with socket mount
- Test pipeline verified (standard jobs work, DIND needs work)
