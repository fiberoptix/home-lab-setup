---

## ✅ COMPLETE: Phase 6 - SonarQube Code Quality Integration

**Status:** COMPLETE - Both test-app and Capricorn integrated!
**Infrastructure:** VM .183 (6GB RAM, 30GB vm-critical, 4 CPU)
**SonarQube:** v26.1.0 operational at http://192.168.1.183:9000
**Next:** Phase 7 (Monitoring) or Phase 8 (Traefik+SSL)

---

## ✅ COMPLETE: Phase 5 - CI/CD Pipelines (QA + GCP Both Working!)

**Infrastructure:** Production-ready with full automation (QA + GCP)
**Status:** Phases 0-5 complete, automated deployments to QA and GCP operational

---

## ✅ Completed This Session (Jan 12-13, 2026)

**Phase 6 Planning (5:00 PM - 5:56 PM):**
- Created comprehensive `/phases/phase6_sonarqube.md` plan
- VM specs: .183, 6GB RAM, 30GB disk on vm-critical (rpool2)

**Phase 6 Implementation (6:00 PM - 9:00 PM):**
- ✅ Created vm-sonarqube-1 (192.168.1.183, 6GB RAM, 30GB vm-critical, 4 CPU)
- ✅ Ran host_setup.sh (Docker, SSH, sudo, NAS, registry config)
- ✅ Installed SonarQube container (Docker)
- ✅ **UPGRADED:** 9.9.8 (lts-community) → 26.1.0 (community latest)
  - Old version showed "no longer active" warning
  - Had to wipe database (incompatible formats)
  - Changed Docker tag from `sonarqube:lts-community` to `sonarqube:community`
- ✅ Changed admin password: Powerme!12345 (12 chars required in new version)
- ✅ Created test-app project in SonarQube
- ✅ Generated test-app token: `sqp_1f2e5062c88890cd98477759b593428ac494576d`
- ✅ Created Capricorn project in SonarQube
- ✅ Generated Capricorn token: `sqp_fcfecef2186a725979f59666e04bb1f451eded3b`
- ✅ Added CI/CD variables to GitLab (SONAR_HOST, SONAR_TOKEN)
- ✅ Fixed variable naming issues (SONAR_ → SONAR_HOST)
- ✅ Updated token after database wipe
- ✅ Added scan stage to test-app/.gitlab-ci.yml
- ✅ Added scan stage to Capricorn/.gitlab-ci.yml (develop branch)
- ✅ **BOTH PIPELINES WORKING:** Scans complete, Quality Gates PASSED!

**Results:**
- test-app: 86 LOC, 0 bugs, 0 security issues ✨
- Capricorn: 28k LOC, Quality Gate PASSED (5 security, 144 reliability, 490 maintainability issues identified)

## ✅ Completed Previous Session (Jan 11, 2026 - Morning Session)

**GitHub Repository Setup (9:00 AM):**
- Published home-lab-setup to GitHub
- Created comprehensive README with hardware specs
- Multiple refinements (hardware cost, Z8 G4, rpool naming)
- 8 commits total to GitHub

**Phase 5 - Test App CI/CD (10:00 AM - 11:30 AM):**
- Created test-app (nginx + animated HTML splash page)
- Built 3-stage pipeline: build → push → deploy
- Fixed Docker API version (docker:27 not docker:24.0)
- Configured CI/CD variables in GitLab
- Setup SSH keys for deployment
- **SUCCESS:** http://192.168.1.180:8080 deployed via pipeline!

**Capricorn CI/CD Integration (11:45 AM - 1:35 PM):**
- Setup dual-remote configuration (GitHub + GitLab)
- Created "production" group in GitLab
- Established branch strategy (develop → QA, production → GCP)
- **CRITICAL REFACTORING:** Renamed all "prod" → "qa" for clarity
  - run-prod.sh → run-qa.sh
  - docker-compose.prod.yml → docker-compose.qa.yml
  - Dockerfile.*.prod → Dockerfile.*.qa
  - Updated all text: "PROD Environment" → "QA Environment (192.168.1.180)"
- Fixed .gitignore blocking lib/ directories (4 missing API files!)
- Created docker-compose.qa.deploy.yml (registry-based deployment)
- Built Capricorn .gitlab-ci.yml pipeline (QA + GCP stages)
- Fixed SSH key loading in pipeline
- **SUCCESS QA:** Capricorn auto-deploys to http://192.168.1.180:5001
- **SUCCESS GCP:** Capricorn deploys to http://capricorn.gothamtechnologies.com
- Added GCP deployment stage (manual trigger on production branch)
- Installed all tools in pipeline: terraform, gcloud, kubectl, docker buildx
- Fixed service account key file creation
- Added git to prerequisites (removes buildx warning)

**Issues Resolved:**
1. Docker API version mismatch (docker:24.0 → docker:27)
2. Registry authentication (CI/CD variables)
3. SSH key deployment (runner to QA host)
4. YAML script syntax (nested strings)
5. Missing lib/api-client.ts files (.gitignore blocking lib/)
6. SSH key format in CI/CD variable
7. Naming confusion (PROD → QA refactoring)
8. Build stages not running on production branch
9. Tool installation (terraform, gcloud, kubectl in Alpine)
10. Service account key file creation from variable
11. Git missing for docker buildx metadata

## Key Achievements

**Complete CI/CD Infrastructure:**
- ✅ GitLab Server verified (git push/pull, Container Registry)
- ✅ GitLab Runner verified (Docker builds, registry push, SSH deploy)
- ✅ Test app pipeline working (validation complete)
- ✅ **Capricorn pipeline working** (production application deployed!)

**Deployment Clarity Established:**
- **DEV** = Local workstation development
- **QA** = vm-kubernetes-1 @ 192.168.1.180 (automated CI/CD)
- **GCP** = Google Cloud Platform (real production)

---

## Previous Sessions

**January 8, 2026:**
- GitHub repository setup and published
- Updated hardware specs and documentation

**December 13, 2025:**
- GitLab Runner (gitlab-runner-1) installed @ 192.168.1.182
- Docker executor configured with socket mount
- Test pipeline verified (standard jobs work, DIND needs work)

---

## Next Steps

**Phase 7 Options:**
- **Option A:** Monitoring Stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
  - System metrics, application monitoring, dashboards
- **Option B:** Traefik + SSL (public HTTPS access)
  - Reverse proxy, automatic SSL certificates

**Future Work:**
- Gmail SMTP: Email notifications for GitLab (low priority)
- Review SonarQube findings and improve code quality
- Consider setting `allow_failure: false` for quality gates
