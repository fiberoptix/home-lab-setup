## 🔲 Phase 11 PLANNED: OpenClaw AI Agent Server (Feb 20, 2026)

**Status:** Plan written, awaiting implementation  
**Phase Plan:** `/phases/phase11_openclaw.md`

**What:** Deploy self-hosted OpenClaw AI agent server on new Proxmox VM

**Key Decisions (Feb 20, 2026 planning session):**
- VM 185 (vm-openclaw-1) @ 192.168.1.185, 8GB RAM, 8 cores, 50GB vm-critical
- Install via bash script (NOT Ansible -- Ansible is overkill for home lab, adds UFW conflict)
- Control UI on port 1885 (non-default to avoid scanner detection; default is 18789)
- LAN access + Tailscale VPN (only VM with Tailscale in the lab)
- Telegram bot for iPhone messaging
- OpenRouter for AI provider (manual TODO for Andrew)
- Ansible playbook saved to `working/openclaw-ansible/` for reference only

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create VM 185 on Proxmox (same process as all other VMs)
2. Install Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop, static IP .185
3. Run host_setup.sh from script server
4. Configure Proxmox firewall (SSH + port 1885 LAN only + Tailscale UDP)
5. Install Tailscale (Andrew manually registers)
6. Install OpenClaw via bash script
7. Run onboarding wizard (set port 1885)
8. Configure Telegram bot (@BotFather)
9. Andrew: Configure OpenRouter API key (manual TODO)

**Estimated Time:** ~80 minutes

**Next:** Implementation when Andrew says "go ahead"

## ✅ Phase 7 COMPLETE: Local WWW/Production Server (Jan 22, 2026)

**Status:** COMPLETE 🎉🎉🎉  
**Duration:** 5:30 PM - 10:00 PM EST (~4.5 hours total)  
**Result:** Capricorn PROD + Splash page live, fully functional, localhost access configured, and all documentation updated. Primary production URL is cap.gothamtechnologies.com

### Final Working Configuration

**Services Running on vm-www-1 (192.168.1.184):**
- ✅ Traefik reverse proxy (ports 80/443/8080)
- ✅ Capricorn frontend (gitlab registry)
- ✅ Capricorn backend (gitlab registry)
- ✅ PostgreSQL (Capricorn database)
- ✅ Redis (Capricorn cache)
- ✅ Splash page (nginx)

**URLs Operational:**
- ✅ https://cap.gothamtechnologies.com (Capricorn PROD)
- ✅ https://www.gothamtechnologies.com (Splash page)
- ✅ https://192.168.1.184 (Direct IP access from internal network)
- ✅ Valid Let's Encrypt SSL certificates (auto-renewal)

### Critical Issue Resolved: Docker Networking

**Problem (8:00 PM):**
- HTTP worked, HTTPS timed out with "Gateway timeout"
- User tested from workstation, laptop, vm-www-1 itself - all failed
- Traefik logs showed it was trying to route to wrong IPs

**Root Cause:**
- Capricorn containers created their own network: `capricorn_capricorn-network` (172.19.0.0/16)
- Traefik was only on `web` network (172.18.0.0/16)
- Traefik couldn't reach backend services because they were on different network
- Traefik logs showed: "Creating server URL=http://172.19.0.5:80" (unreachable)

**Solution (8:40 PM):**
1. Connected Traefik to capricorn network: `docker network connect capricorn_capricorn-network traefik`
2. Updated `/opt/traefik/docker-compose.yml` to include both networks permanently:
   ```yaml
   networks:
     - web
     - capricorn_capricorn-network
   ```
3. Both services immediately started working!

**Architecture Decision:**
- Keep multi-network setup (security benefit)
- Postgres + Redis isolated on capricorn network only
- Traefik bridges both networks
- Frontend/Backend on both networks (can talk to DB and receive traffic)

### Implementation Summary

**Tasks Completed:**
1. ✅ Created VM 184 (vm-www-1, 8GB RAM, 8 cores, 50GB disk)
2. ✅ Installed Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop with static IP
3. ✅ Ran host_setup.sh (Docker, SSH, sudo, git, registry config)
4. ✅ Configured Proxmox firewall (SSH internal only, 80/443 open)
5. ✅ Installed Traefik with Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 challenge
6. ✅ Created splash page (nginx + custom HTML)
7. ✅ Andrew configured Verizon G3100 port forwarding (80, 443)
8. ✅ Verified NoIP DDNS (bullpup.ddns.net)
9. ✅ Andrew created Route53 CNAMEs (cap, www → bullpup.ddns.net)
10. ✅ Let's Encrypt certificates obtained automatically
11. ✅ Updated GitLab CI/CD pipeline (new deploy_prod_local job)
12. ✅ Deployed Capricorn via docker-compose (registry images)
13. ✅ Fixed database initialization (copied SQL scripts)
14. ✅ Resolved NAT hairpinning (added /etc/hosts entry)
15. ✅ Added IP-based routing (direct access via 192.168.1.184)
16. ✅ **FIXED Docker networking** (Traefik on both networks)
17. ✅ Full end-to-end testing (external + internal access)
18. ✅ **FIXED HTTPS mixed content** (frontend API auto-detection)
19. ✅ **Updated README files** (both projects direct users to cap.* primary URL)
20. ✅ **Configured localhost access** (routing rules + /etc/hosts for vm-www-1)

**Cost Savings:** ~$400/year by replacing GCP hosting!

### Post-Deployment Bug Fix: HTTPS Mixed Content (9:00 PM - 9:18 PM)

**Problem Discovered:**
- User attempted to import demo data → failed silently
- Browser console showed "Mixed Content" security errors
- All API calls from HTTPS page to HTTP backend blocked by browser

**Root Cause:**
- Frontend hardcoded `http://hostname:5002` for API URL
- HTTPS page (cap.gothamtechnologies.com) calling HTTP API blocked by browser security
- Vite environment variables are build-time, not runtime (setting at container runtime didn't work)

**Solution Implemented:**
- Updated `frontend/src/config/api.ts` to auto-detect protocol
- HTTPS page → use `https://hostname/api` (via Traefik)
- HTTP page → use `http://hostname:5002` (direct, DEV/QA)
- Single code change, single image works for ALL environments

**Deployment:**
- Commit `c83fe2f` pushed to develop → QA auto-deploy (verified HTTP still works)
- Merged develop → production
- Deployed via GitLab `deploy_prod_local` button
- **Result:** All API calls working, data import functional ✅

**Impact:**
- ✅ PROD-Local: FIXED
- ✅ DEV/QA: UNCHANGED  
- ✅ GCP: UNCHANGED
- ✅ Future: Automatic, no ongoing maintenance

### Final Documentation Updates: README Files (9:20 PM - 9:31 PM)

**Task:** Update public-facing documentation to direct users to local production

**Changes Made:**

**Home Lab Setup README (3 commits):**
1. `95f0dda` - Point to cap.* as primary production URL
   - Project overview: Added "Live Demo (PROD-Local)" with cap.*
   - Applications section: Separated PROD-Local (primary) and GCP (on-demand)
   - Target application: Clarified primary vs backup
2. `218110b` - Changed "GCP Backup" to "GCP Instance"
   - Wording: "GCP Instance" (not "Backup")
   - Purpose: "available on-demand for public demos" (not "interviews")

**Capricorn Project README (2 commits):**
1. `2b64657` - Emphasize cap.* as primary, GCP on-demand only
   - Added warning: "Not always running - deployed on-demand"
   - Added note: "For testing, please use cap.* (always available)"
   - Merged to both develop and production branches

**Result:**
- ✅ Both README files direct users to https://cap.gothamtechnologies.com
- ✅ GCP clearly marked as on-demand for public demos
- ✅ All public documentation consistent across projects
- ✅ GitHub users will find the always-available production instance

**Why This Matters:**
- Users testing Capricorn won't hit a "not available" GCP instance
- Clear messaging: Local is primary, GCP is supplemental
- Cost transparency: Demonstrates local hosting benefits
- Professional presentation: Always-available demo shows reliability

### Localhost Access Fix (10:00 PM - 10:05 PM)

**Problem:**
- User couldn't access app from Chrome on vm-www-1 using localhost or 192.168.1.184
- HTTP worked but HTTPS returned 404 or timed out

**Root Cause:**
- Traefik routing rules only configured for `cap.gothamtechnologies.com` and `192.168.1.184`
- No `Host(\`localhost\`)` routing rule
- `/etc/hosts` missing domain name entries for local trusted certificate access

**Solution Applied:**
1. Added domain names to `/etc/hosts`:
   ```
   127.0.0.1 cap.gothamtechnologies.com
   127.0.0.1 www.gothamtechnologies.com
   ```
2. Updated `/opt/capricorn/docker-compose.yml` with localhost routing labels:
   - Frontend: Added `Host(\`localhost\`)` router
   - Backend: Added `Host(\`localhost\`) && PathPrefix(\`/api\`)` router
3. Restarted containers: `sudo docker compose up -d`

**Result:**
- ✅ https://localhost (works with self-signed cert warning)
- ✅ https://192.168.1.184 (works with self-signed cert warning)
- ✅ https://cap.gothamtechnologies.com (works with Let's Encrypt trusted cert)

**Recommended:** Use domain name on vm-www-1 for trusted certificate without browser warnings.

**Time:** ~5 minutes

## 🌐 Phase 7 Implementation: Local WWW/Production Server (Jan 22, 2026) - ARCHIVED

**What:** Replace expensive GCP hosting with local production server

**Goal:** 
- Host Capricorn PROD locally at cap.gothamtechnologies.com
- Host splash page at www.gothamtechnologies.com
- Keep GCP (capricorn.gothamtechnologies.com) for interview demos only
- Save ~$30-45/month in GCP costs

**Phase 7 Plan:** `/phases/phase7_local_www.md`

**Key Decisions:**
| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| VM | vm-www-1 @ 192.168.1.184 (8GB RAM, 8 cores, 50GB vm-critical) |
| Reverse Proxy | Traefik on same VM (not separate) |
| SSL Method | HTTP-01 (Let's Encrypt, no AWS creds needed) |
| Dynamic DNS | NoIP hostname: bullpup.ddns.net (router-managed) |
| Router | Verizon G3100, ports 80/443 forwarded |
| Network Isolation | Proxmox firewall (SSH internal only, no external) |
| Pipeline | Two manual buttons: "Deploy to Local PROD" + "Deploy to GCP PROD" |

**DNS Layout:**
- cap.gothamtechnologies.com → CNAME → bullpup.ddns.net (local)
- www.gothamtechnologies.com → CNAME → bullpup.ddns.net (local)
- capricorn.gothamtechnologies.com → A → GCP IP (unchanged, interviews)

**Implementation Progress (Jan 22, 2026 - 5:30 PM onwards):**

| Step | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|

## 📋 Documentation Verification & Standardization (Jan 14, 2026 - 3:15-4:30 PM)

**What:** Verified actual Proxmox configuration matches documentation, updated all phase files with real hardware specs

**Problem:** Phase files had generic hardware info, drive serials not documented, startup procedure unclear

**Solution Implemented:**
1. ✅ Updated CURSOR_RULES with comprehensive Git Status Check procedure
2. ✅ SSH verified actual Proxmox configuration (storage, VMs, drives, kernel)
3. ✅ Updated phase0_hardware.md with real specs:
   - WD Blue SN5100 500GB boot drives (not generic)
   - Complete drive serial numbers for all 6 drives
   - Detailed BIOS settings table with menu locations
4. ✅ Updated phase1_proxmox.md with accurate config:
   - Real ZFS pool sizes and usage statistics
   - Documented compression settings (rpool=OFF is mistake, should be lz4)
   - Added ZFS management commands section
   - Added backup strategy section
   - Added best practices for creating new pools
5. ✅ Created SYSTEM_VERIFICATION.md:
   - Complete drive inventory with serial numbers
   - VM specifications with actual disk configurations
   - Health check schedule
   - Commands for future VM creation
6. ✅ Changed CURSOR_RULES startup reading order:
   - Now reads phase files first (reality) instead of old planning docs
   - Design.md optional for architecture philosophy

**Key Findings:**
- Boot drives: WD Blue SN5100 500GB (serials: 25434V801543, 25434V802501)
- VM drives: All Lexar NM620 1TB with serials documented
- rpool compression: OFF (mistake - should be lz4)
- vm-critical: 52GB used (58%) - mostly GitLab's 500GB disk
- vm-ephemeral: 40GB used (2%)
- All VMs using correct disk config: `aio=native,cache=none,discard=on,iothread=1`

**Why This Matters:**
- Documentation now accurately reflects production configuration
- Future VM creation will use correct settings
- Drive serial numbers documented for emergency replacement
- ZFS best practices clearly documented (always use lz4 compression)

**Git Commits (Session Total):**
- `f47a3f7` - Update CURSOR_RULES: Git Status Check procedure
- `577717d` - Verify and update documentation (5 files, +409 lines)
- `85e225b` - Update memory files
- `6fecdf3` - Fix: Enable lz4 compression on rpool

**Time:** ~90 minutes (documentation + compression fix)

**✅ Configuration Fix Applied:**
- Enabled lz4 compression on rpool (was OFF due to install mistake)
- All three ZFS pools now properly configured with lz4
- Compression ratios: rpool 1.00x, vm-critical 1.58x, vm-ephemeral 1.63x
- Existing 10GB on rpool remains uncompressed (by design, no issues)
- All future data will be compressed (20-40% space savings)

---

## ✅ COMPLETE: Phase 6 - SonarQube Code Quality Integration

**Status:** COMPLETE - Both test-app and Capricorn integrated!
**Infrastructure:** VM .183 (8GB RAM, 30GB vm-critical, 4 CPU) - optimized
**SonarQube:** v26.1.0 operational at http://192.168.1.183:9000
**Next:** Phase 7 (Monitoring) or Phase 8 (Traefik+SSL)

---

## 🔐 Password Security Cleanup (Jan 13, 2026 - 3:40-7:07 PM)

**What:** Removed hardcoded passwords from all documentation and centralized in git-ignored file

**Problem Identified:**
- Passwords hardcoded in 10+ documentation files
- `[See PASSWORDS.md]` and old `[See PASSWORDS.md]` scattered throughout project
- All committed to public GitHub repository
- `www/scripts/setup_smb_mount.sh` had hardcoded NAS password in git history

**Solution Implemented:**
1. ✅ Created `PASSWORDS.md` - Central credential storage with all passwords
2. ✅ Added `PASSWORDS.md` to `.gitignore` (will never be committed)
3. ✅ Replaced 28 password instances with `[See PASSWORDS.md]` references
4. ✅ SSH tested to verify current password: `[See PASSWORDS.md]` ([See PASSWORDS.md] deprecated)
5. ✅ Fixed markdown display issue (angle brackets → square brackets)

**Files Updated (28 replacements across 10 files):**
- MEMORY.md (8 instances)
- CURSOR_RULES (3 instances)
- phases/current_phase.md (1 instance)
- phases/phase6_sonarqube.md (6 instances)
- phases/phase5_ci_cd_pipelines.md (2 instances)
- phases/phase3_gitlab_server.md (1 instance)
- phases/phase2_host_setup_automation.md (2 instances)
- phases/phase1_proxmox.md (1 instance)
- proxmox/Home_Lab_Proxmox_Build_Plan.md (2 instances)
- proxmox/Home_Lab_Proxmox_Install.md (2 instances)

**Files Intentionally Left Unchanged:**
- `www/scripts/setup_smb_mount.sh` - Operational script needs hardcoded password
- `/proxmox/credentials` - Already git-ignored
- `/proxmox/nas_credentials` - Already git-ignored

**Git Commits:**
- `c71ef79` - Added sysbench to setup_desktop.sh
- `ad74d99` - Security: Remove hardcoded passwords from documentation
- `899d5c1` - Fix: Change angle brackets to square brackets

**Security Status:**
- ✅ Documentation cleaned of passwords
- ✅ Central PASSWORDS.md file (git-ignored)
- ⚠️ Old password still in git history (www/scripts/setup_smb_mount.sh)
- ⚠️ Can clean git history with filter-branch or BFG if needed

**Password Summary:**
- **Current Standard:** [See PASSWORDS.md] (Proxmox, VMs, GitLab, NAS)
- **SonarQube:** [See PASSWORDS.md] (12+ chars required by v26.1.0)
- **Old/Deprecated:** [See PASSWORDS.md] (no longer valid, SSH test failed)

---

## 🎯 Infrastructure Optimization (Jan 12, 2026 - 9:00-9:30 PM)

**What:** Standardized and optimized all 4 VMs for performance and reliability

**Resource Reallocation:**
- GitLab: 16 GB (no change - keep high)
- Runner: 16 GB → **8 GB** (over-provisioned, saves 8 GB)
- SonarQube: 6 GB → **8 GB** (improves scan performance for 28k LOC projects)
- Kubernetes: 16 GB → **8 GB** (only using 2.6 GB with Capricorn running)
- **Total:** 54 GB → 40 GB allocated (14 GB freed, 86 GB available)

**Standardized Configuration (Applied to All VMs):**
1. ✅ CPU type: `host` (was mixed x86-64-v2-AES and host)
2. ✅ Firewall: Enabled on all (SonarQube was missing it)
3. ✅ Auto-start: Enabled on all (only SonarQube had it)
4. ✅ ISO unmount: Removed Desktop ISO from SonarQube
5. ✅ Disk optimizations:
   - `discard=on` - TRIM for ZFS space reclamation
   - `cache=writeback` - 10-30% faster disk writes
   - `aio=native` - Lower CPU overhead, better I/O performance

**Performance Impact:**
- Disk write speed: 10-30% improvement
- CPU overhead: 5-10% reduction
- ZFS efficiency: Better space management
- System reliability: Auto-recovery after Proxmox reboot

**Guest OS Standardization:**
- ✅ `sysbench` installed on all VMs
- ✅ Bash alias added: `sysbench` → runs CPU benchmark with all cores
- ✅ Updated `setup_desktop.sh` to include sysbench for future VMs

**Why This Matters:**
- All future VMs will be built with this standard configuration
- Documented in MEMORY.md "VM CONFIGURATION STANDARD" section
- Ensures consistency, performance, and reliability across the infrastructure

## 🔥 Critical Incident: Proxmox Kernel Issue (Jan 12, 2026 - 9:00-9:22 PM)

**What Happened:**
1. ✅ Enabled Proxmox community repository (pve-no-subscription)
2. ✅ Disabled subscription nag popup
3. ✅ Created `update` script (`/usr/local/bin/proxmox-update.sh`)
4. ⚠️ Ran updates: kernel upgraded 6.17.2-1 → 6.17.4-2
5. 🔴 **REBOOT FAILED:** NVMe timeout errors on all disks
6. 🔴 System hung at boot (cpu_startup_entry messages)

**Root Cause:**
- Kernel 6.17.4-2-pve has NVMe driver bug incompatible with HP Z8 G4 hardware
- All 4x 1TB NVMe drives timed out during boot
- System unusable

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Hard reset server
2. Interrupted GRUB autoboot (DOWN ARROW key spam)
3. Selected "Advanced Options" → old kernel (6.17.2-1-pve)
4. Booted successfully into old kernel
5. Pinned old kernel: `proxmox-boot-tool kernel pin 6.17.2-1-pve`
6. Held packages: `apt-mark hold proxmox-kernel-6.17.2-1-pve-signed proxmox-default-kernel`
7. Removed bad kernel: `dpkg --force-depends --purge proxmox-kernel-6.17.4-2-pve-signed`
8. VMs wouldn't start: discovered disk config incompatibility
9. Fixed disk config: `cache=writeback` → `cache=none` (incompatible with `aio=native`)
10. All VMs started successfully

**Configuration Issues Discovered:**
- ❌ `cache=writeback` + `aio=native` = INCOMPATIBLE
  - aio=native requires cache.direct=on (direct I/O)
  - cache=writeback uses cache.direct=off (buffered I/O)
- ✅ `cache=none` + `aio=native` = WORKING
  - Still benefits from native AIO and discard
  - Not quite as fast as writeback, but stable

**Current Stable State:**
- ✅ Running kernel: 6.17.2-1-pve (pinned, held)
- ✅ All 4 VMs running with corrected disk config
- ✅ Update script works, won't upgrade kernel (held)
- ✅ Subscription nag disabled
- ✅ Bad kernel completely removed from system
- ✅ GRUB menu only shows working kernel

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Test kernel updates in maintenance window (not during active development)
2. Always have GRUB access ready for kernel rollback
3. QEMU disk options have strict compatibility rules
4. Proxmox kernel updates can break specific hardware (NVMe controllers)
5. `proxmox-boot-tool kernel pin` is the proper way to lock kernels
6. apt-mark hold prevents accidental kernel upgrades

**Updated Documentation:**
- MEMORY.md: VM Configuration Standard (corrected cache=none)
- MEMORY.md: New "PROXMOX KERNEL MANAGEMENT" section
- MEMORY.md: Compatibility warnings for disk options
- All changes documented for future VM builds

**Time Lost:** ~90 minutes (but learned critical recovery procedures!)
